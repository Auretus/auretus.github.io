            <p>I'm a secular transhumanist, a SF&amp;F enthusiast, player of games both electronic and tabletop, and an
                unrepentant technophile. My pronouns are he/him, and I identify as a cisgender male.
            </p>
            <p>
                Born in the desert wastes of southern California some three dozen years ago, I spent my formative years
                striving to understand the world around me&mdash;a pursuit that has never ceased since. Migrating to
                Florida with my family, I adapted to the slightly cooler (though much wetter) climate only under
                protest. Retreating from the unblinking gaze of the daystar, I dedicated myself to intellectual
                pursuits, specifically ones that would allow me to stay out of the heat as much as possible.
            </p>
            <p>
                My primary foci of interest center around technology, discovery, and playful exploration. I build
                computers for myself and my friends, engaging in mild-to-moderate hardware modding where needed to
                achieve the desired result. I have a strong interest in computer games of many sorts, with a special
                focus on Roleplaying games. Tabletop roleplaying games are another passion of mine, and I have both
                participated in and run dozens of games over the years. I greatly enjoy creative visual storytelling,
                and have a special passion for anime and manga. I also enjoy well-written speculative fiction, with my
                favorite stories being ones that serve equally well as entertainment and education.
            </p>
            <p> I live underneath one of the primary inbound glidepaths for Orlando International Airport, close enough
                that trying to enjoy a nap&mdash;or even an uninterrupted conversation&mdash;in my back yard is an
                exercise in futility most days.
            </p>
            <p>
                My dream job is something that lets me bend my talents with technology toward the goal of promoting the
                flourishing of sapient life across the planet, across the solar system, and beyond (if I get really
                lucky).
